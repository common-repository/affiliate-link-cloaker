Plugin designed to cloak an affiliate hoplink so users see a pretty URL, and to prevent link hijacking.

== Description ==

This plugin inserts a small piece of JavaScript into a cloaked post in order to give your
users a pretty URL (amazon affiliate URLs are *horrible*) as well as prevent link hijacking
(when another affiliate substitutes their own affiliate ID for yours) and users from removing
or replacing your affiliate ID.

== Installation ==

1. Download the Affiliate Cloaker Plugin and extract link_cloaker.php
2. Copy the file into your wp-content/plugins/ folder
3. Go to the Plugins menu in WordPress and activate the Affiliate Cloaker plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this for SEO cloaking? =

Absolutely not. This is only for creating pretty hoplinks and preventing link hijacking/modification.

= Will it work for all links? =

I recommend testing with your links to ensure your cookie gets dropped properly. I know it works with Clickbank.

= I get a "post not found" for cloaked posts, not a redirect. Sup? =

Make sure you're using a valid URL (i.e. http://somedomain.com) If you're still having difficulty, email
me at info@m7tech.net
